## üîç Overview

This reporting layer provides curated, high-value metrics and analyses derived from cleansed Silver Layer data. These insights support tactical and strategic decisions across operational, financial, and customer dimensions.

All queries run against the **Gold Layer** in the `Fleet` database and are production-ready for visualisation in Power BI and distribution to EXCO, OEMs, and internal GM stakeholders.

## üìà Advanced Data Analysis

| Use Case                | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Change-over-Time     | Monthly utilization trends by year.                              |
| 2. Cumulative Analysis  | YTD revenue trends per branch using running totals.              |
| 3. Performance Analysis | Compare maintenance costs vs operating profit by month & branch. |
| 4. Part-to-Whole        | Branch-level contribution to total annual revenue.               |
| 5. Data Segmentation    | Utilization behavior by vehicle segment.                         |

1. Change-over-Time Analysis
```sql
-- Monthly Fleet Utilization Trend
SELECT 
    dt.year,
    dt.month,
    AVG(fp.utilization_rate) AS avg_utilization_rate
FROM gold.FactFleetPerformance fp
JOIN gold.DimTime dt ON fp.time_key = dt.time_key
GROUP BY dt.year, dt.month
ORDER BY dt.year, dt.month;
```
---
2. Cumulative Analysis
```sql
-- YTD Revenue by Branch
SELECT 
    dt.year,
    dt.month,
    b.branch_name,
    SUM(SUM(ff.revenue)) OVER (PARTITION BY b.branch_name, dt.year ORDER BY dt.month) AS ytd_revenue
FROM gold.FactFinancials ff
JOIN gold.DimTime dt ON ff.time_key = dt.time_key
JOIN gold.DimBranches b ON ff.branch_key = b.branch_key
GROUP BY dt.year, dt.month, b.branch_name
ORDER BY b.branch_name, dt.year, dt.month;
GO
```
---
3. Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Maintenance Cost vs Operating Profit
SELECT 
    dt.year,
    dt.month,
    b.branch_name,
    SUM(fp.maintenance_cost) AS total_maintenance_cost,
    SUM(f.revenue * 0.2) AS operating_profit
FROM gold.FactFleetPerformance fp
JOIN gold.DimTime dt ON fp.time_key = dt.time_key
JOIN gold.DimBranches b ON fp.branch_key = b.branch_key
JOIN gold.FactFinancials f ON f.time_key = dt.time_key AND f.branch_key = b.branch_key
GROUP BY dt.year, dt.month, b.branch_name
ORDER BY dt.year, dt.month, b.branch_name;
```
---
4. Part-to-Whole Analysis
```sql
-- Revenue Contribution by Branch (Annual)
SELECT 
    dt.year,
    b.branch_name,
    SUM(f.revenue) AS branch_revenue,
    SUM(SUM(f.revenue)) OVER (PARTITION BY dt.year) AS total_revenue,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(f.revenue) / SUM(SUM(f.revenue)) OVER (PARTITION BY dt.year), 2) AS revenue_pct
FROM gold.FactFinancials f
JOIN gold.DimTime dt ON f.time_key = dt.time_key
JOIN gold.DimBranches b ON f.branch_key = b.branch_key
GROUP BY dt.year, b.branch_name
ORDER BY dt.year, revenue_pct DESC;
```

5. Data Segmentation
```sql
-- Utilization Rate by Vehicle Segment
SELECT 
    v.segment,
    ROUND(AVG(fp.utilization_rate), 2) AS avg_utilization_rate,
    COUNT(*) AS vehicle_records
FROM gold.FactFleetPerformance fp
JOIN gold.DimVehicles v ON fp.vehicle_key = v.vehicle_key
GROUP BY v.segment
ORDER BY avg_utilization_rate DESC;
```

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Dimensions        | Volume of unique Customers, Vehicles, Branches, and Dates.    |
| 2. Customer Segments | Counts by `customer_type` and `customer_segment`.             |
| 3. Date Coverage     | Earliest/latest telemetry date to validate time series range. |
| 4. Measure Spread    | Min, Max, Avg of Revenue and EBITDA by Branch.                |
| 5. Magnitude         | Top branches with the highest vehicle downtime.               |
| 6. Ranking           | Top 5 branches by profit margin (%).                          |
